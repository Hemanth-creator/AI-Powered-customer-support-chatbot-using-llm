# AI Powered customer support chatbot using llm

## Project Overview
This project is a Streamlit application that integrates a Google Generative AI model with a Microsoft SQL Server database to create an AI-powered customer assistant. The application allows users to input natural language queries, which are processed by the Google Generative AI (Gemini) model to generate and execute SQL queries on the underlying database. It then returns responses based on the data from the database, simulating a polite customer service agent.

## Main Features
- <b>Natural Language Querying:</b> Users can ask questions in plain English, and the AI converts the query into SQL.
- <b>Database Interaction:</b> The AI dynamically interacts with a SQL Server database, fetching relevant data.
- <b>Polite AI Response:</b> The AI responds in a polite customer service tone, ensuring the user receives helpful feedback.
- <b>Streamlit Frontend:</b> Easy-to-use interface for user interaction.
- <b>Error Handling:</b> If there is insufficient data, the assistant provides a response that reflects the data limitations.
